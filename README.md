# Serving machine learning models

This library provides some basic functionality for serving machine learning models from a flask server via an API. It serves more as a tutorial of how to rather than production grade server, and is as such  more of a complement to the lightweight/specific services often found in blogs. It has been developed with cloud architecture in mind, but workswell in other situations as well.

## Install
While you could install the library, the installation is more aimed at providing a simple way of deploying using Docker. But, to install simply
```
pip install git+https://github.com/tingiskhan/ml-server
```
